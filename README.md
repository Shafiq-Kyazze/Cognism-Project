# Cognism Take home Project



### *Objectives*
 1. Produce a python class that  returns a dictionary that returns  name compnents of the given string.
 2. Organise the test data files in a serverless database engine such as  SQLite for better file management and organisation.

### *How the code works*

 - [ ] The database configuration files can be found in the Database folder which contains the test data files, the SQLite   
     database(cognism_db.sqlite) etcetra

 - [ ] The models module holds the data models that were used to build
       the tables that house the data from   the test data files
 - [ ] The database.py file creates a SQLite database   that holds the   data models.

 - [ ] The SQLite terminal commands text file   shows the terminal  commands that were used to import the data from   the text and  tsv files into the database.
 - [ ] Task_1 module  holds the python class which takes a company_name as a string input and returns the desired dictionary through querying the database.
